-----------------
 Troubleshooting
-----------------

- Ardesia does not start and says that you must enable a composite manager
  - setup your computer to use the accelerated graphic drivers
    - intel graphics card might work with the free driver
    - nvidia graphics driver you must install the proprietary driver
    - ati you must install the proprietary driver
  - if you are using Gnome go in the panel under System/Preference/Appearance and put
    the visuals effect to normal
  - if you are using kde enable the kwin composite manager

- Ardesia bar is not full visible, it is greater than my desktop
  - try to put the bar in horizontal position with the gravity option
    e.g. ardesia -g south

- I can not move the Ardesia Bar. Why?
  - I have put the bar in the right of the screen because is the best
    position to be accessible with the hand and it does not hide
    important thinks on the desktop
    Anyway you can choose the position starting the Ardesia bar
    with the decorate option
    e.g. ardesia -d
    Now you can move the ardesia bar everywhere

- Ardesia is not able to record my desktop
  - check that you audio driver works fine, recording some speak
    with an other program
  - install the vlc package (it's required)
    http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
  - if you use Windows add the vlc folder to the PATH environment variable
  - if you have other problems try to customize the
    $PREFIX/share/ardesia/scripts/screencast.sh
    or share\ardesia\scripts\screencast.bat if you use Windows

- I have read that with Ardesia I can put my presentation on the web.
  How I can do this?
  - Ardesia supports the live screencast streaming
    only after that you have configured the file
    properly
    In order to make a presentation you must have:
    - A running icecast2 server
      (if you want to be reachable from Internet this machine must have
       a public IP address and a domain name)
    - A local machine that you use to make the presentation
      This computer must:
      - reach the icecast2 server
      - have ardesia installed
    - Open the file $PREFIX/share/ardesia/scripts/screencast.sh
      or share\ardesia\scripts\screencast.bat if you use Windows
      - Uncomment the line
        - ICECAST="TRUE";
      - Set these variable
        - ICECAST_PASSWORD
        - ICECAST_ADDRESS
        - ICECAST_PORT
        - ICECAST_MOUNTPOINT
    - Open Ardesia
    - Push the record button
    - Select a name
    - Enjoy the stream at the uri
      http://ICECAST_LOCATION:ICECAST_PORT/ICECAST_MOUNTPOINT.ogg
    - Now you can put this link on a web page or publish it in an other way
    - For furthermore information about icecast2 server please
